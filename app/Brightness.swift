//  F1/F2, so every display moves (including externals that DisplayServicesSetBrightness misses),
//  one notch at a time (a gradual dim/restore).
//
//  "Should we restore?" is decided on the MAIN thread by BOTH an `isDimmed` flag (for dims WE did)
//  AND a live brightness read via DisplayServices (so a manual/keyboard-dimmed screen is also
//  restored when you touch the remote). Reading must be on main — off the trackpad's background
//  callback thread the read is unreliable, which is why touch didn't restore before.
