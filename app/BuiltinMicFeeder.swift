//  Phase 2b of the virtual-mic fallback: feeds the Mac's BUILT-IN microphone into the
//  "/SiriRemoteMicBuiltin" shared-memory ring (BuiltinMicRingWriter.c) that the
//  SiriRemoteMic HAL plug-in serves whenever the remote's voice ring is stale. Net
//  effect: an app that selected "Siri Remote Mic" always hears something sensible —
//  the room via the built-in mic normally, the remote's mic while Siri is held.
//
//  Three rules this file exists to enforce:
//
//  1. NEVER touch the "default input" device. If the user makes "Siri Remote Mic"
//     their default mic (the whole point of the feature), capturing the default would
//     capture our OWN virtual device — which is playing the very ring we are writing —
//     and howl. Capture uses a raw AUHAL unit bound to the CoreAudio device with UID
//     "BuiltInMicrophoneDevice" (fallback: transport Built-in with input streams)
//     BEFORE the unit is ever initialized, and refuses to run unbound. Deliberately
//     not AVAudioEngine: its inputNode starts life on the default input and its setup
//     enumerates the whole device graph — third-party aggregate devices included.
//
//  2. The mic is only hot while some app actually has the virtual device open OR while
//     the user is physically holding the configured Voice button and its live waveform
//     needs a level. The plug-in broadcasts the Darwin notification
//     au.holodata.SiriRemoteMic.consumers with state = number of clients running IO (the
//     same demand signal srm_captured uses). Both demands stop immediately on their
//     release edge; an idle Mac never has its microphone open because of this feature.
//
//  3. NOTHING here runs on the main thread. HAL property calls are synchronous mach
//     IPC into coreaudiod and can stall for minutes when it is busy — observed live,
//     with the whole app (and the remote) frozen behind one such call. All capture
//     work is confined to a private serial queue; the main thread never waits on it.
