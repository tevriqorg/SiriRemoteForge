//  FocusFollowsCursor.swift
//  HyperVibe
//
//  Focus the app the cursor is over, so a keystroke binding lands where you are pointing rather
//  than wherever you last clicked. Scrolling a browser on another display and then pressing a
//  button used to send that shortcut to the app you left behind.
//
//  RESTRICTED TO APPS THAT ALREADY FILL A DISPLAY, deliberately. macOS has no public way to give an
//  app keyboard focus without also raising it, so an unrestricted focus-follows-mouse would reshuffle
//  the window stack every time the pointer crossed something — unusable while working normally. An
//  app already covering a whole display has nothing to disturb: raising it changes nothing visible.
//  That is what makes this safe to run continuously.
//
//  "Fills a display" rather than "is fullscreen", on purpose. Native fullscreen is the obvious case,
//  but a maximised window — menu bar still showing — is just as safe and far more common; testing
//  for literal fullscreen bounds matched none of the author's own windows.
//
//  The test is a COVERAGE FRACTION rather than an exact match, for two measured reasons. Chrome (and
//  others) split their tab strip and content into separate CGWindows that only cover the display
//  taken together, so the app's windows are unioned. And `NSScreen.visibleFrame` cannot be used as
//  the target: on a display that is not currently active macOS reports it equal to the full frame,
//  reserving no menu bar, even though windows there are still laid out below one — so an exact-cover
//  test failed on exactly the kind of window it was meant to accept.
//
//  Consequence worth knowing: a small or partially-covering window is never focused this way. That
//  is the point, not a gap.
