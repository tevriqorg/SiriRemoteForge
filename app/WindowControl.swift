//  Window-state changes on the frontmost window: full screen, minimise.
//
//  NOT by synthesizing the menu shortcut. Ctrl+Cmd+F is the shortcut every app carries for full
//  screen, and it looks like it should work, but a synthesized chord does not take effect — the
//  same wall the Space-switching hotkeys hit. What does work is the Accessibility API: a standard
//  window exposes writable `AXFullScreen` and `AXMinimized` attributes, and setting them performs
//  the real transition, animation included. Cmd+M would probably work where Ctrl+Cmd+F did not,
//  but there is no way to know which menu shortcuts are honoured without testing each one, and the
//  AX route needs no such luck.
//
//  Requires the Accessibility permission the app already needs to synthesize input at all.
